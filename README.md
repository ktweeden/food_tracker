# Pickle
A calorie free daily food tracker for android created in week 9 of my software development course at [CodeClan](http://codeclan.com)

## Brief
### Goal
Practice OO and UI design with what we learned in Java / Android weeks

### MVP
You are required to write an Android app that allows a user to track the food they eat. Users should be able to enter what they eat and when (date/time) and for what meal.

### Project Extension
The app should show the user a record of what they have eaten over a given period e.g. In March I drank lots of Irn-Bru.
